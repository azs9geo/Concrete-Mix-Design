I wrote this code as one of my undergrad projects. This python code can calculate the ratios of cement:coarse aggregate:fine aggregate:water based on the following parameters:
    Compressive Strength
    Concrete Type
    Structure Type
    Slump Value
    Maximum Aggregate Size
    FM Value
    Moisture Content of Coarse Aggregate
    Moisture Content of Fine Aggregate
The code will guide you through the above input parameters once you start running it.


The code follows ACI 211.1-91. Following tables from ACI 211.1-91 was used in this program.

1.  Table 6.3.3
2.  Table 6.3.7.1
3.  Table 6.3.6

For interpolation, Stirling's Interpolation Formula and Newtons Generel Interpolation Formula was used.

If any discrepancies or inaacurate result is shown, please notify me.

Feel free to use the code in any way you wish. If you give me credit, it will be appreciated.
